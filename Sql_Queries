  of the month as the group by value  --
  
  
SELECT month(start_date) AS month_start_date, COUNT(*) AS trial_count FROM Subscriptions
JOIN Plans ON Subscriptions.plan_id = Plans.plan_id
WHERE Plans.plan_name = 'Trial'
GROUP BY month_start_date
ORDER BY month_start_date;



3.What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by 
  count of events for each plan_name 


select A.plan_id,count(*) from
(select s.*,p.plan_name,p.price from subscriptions as s  join plans as p on 
p.plan_id=s.plan_id WHERE start_date > '2020-12-31') A
GROUP BY plan_id ORDER BY plan_id;



4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place 


WITH churn_cx as (
select s.*,p.plan_name,p.price from subscriptions as s  join plans as p on 
p.plan_id=s.plan_id WHERE plan_name ='CHURN')

select count(*) as Churned,
concat(round((count(*)/
(SELECT count(distinct customer_id) FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions))*100,1),'',"%")
as Percentage_Churned
from churn_cx



5.How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial what percentage is this rounded
  to the nearest whole number? -- 


with Next_PLAN AS(
 SELECT *,LEAD(plan_id) over(partition by customer_id order by start_date)
 as new_plan from subscriptions )
 
select count(*),
round((count(*)*100)/(select count(distinct customer_id) from subscriptions),2)
as Churn_Percent
FROM Next_PLAN WHERE PLAN_ID = 0 AND NeW_PLAN =4



6.What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?


select count(*) as Total_Subscription , 
Round((count(*)/1000)*100,1) as Percentage_Subcribers
from
(select a.*,rank() over(partition by customer_id order by start_date) rnk from
  (SELECT s.*,p.plan_name,p.price  FROM Subscriptions s
  JOIN Plans p ON S.plan_id = P.plan_id ) a ) b
where rnk > 1
 
 
 
 
 
7.What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31? 



With Ranking_By_Date as (
 select *, row_number() over(partition by customer_id order by start_date desc)
 as rnks from subscriptions where start_date <= '2020-12-31')

select plan_id,
count(distinct customer_id) as Customers_Count,
Round((count(customer_id)*100)/(SELECT  count(distinct customer_id) FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions),2)
as Percentage_Of_Cx
from Ranking_By_Date where rnks= 1 group by plan_id ;




8.How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020 ?


With CUSTOMER_Annual_Subscriptions as
(SELECT *,rank() over(partition by customer_id order by start_date desc) as rnk
 FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions where year(start_date)= 2020 )
 
select plan_id,count(*) as Annual_Subscription from CUSTOMER_Annual_Subscriptions
where plan_id = 3 and rnk = 1 group by plan_id ;




9.How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi? 


with Min_Date as(
 select min(start_date) as Joined_Date,customer_id from subscriptions 
 group by customer_id)
 ,Plan_ID3_Date as(
 select start_date as annual_date,customer_id from subscriptions
  where plan_id = 3 )

select Round(Avg(annual_date-joined_date),2) as avg_days from 
Min_date inner join Plan_ID3_Date on 
Min_date.customer_id=Plan_ID3_Date.Customer_id ;
